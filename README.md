## Functional Testing
Functional testing aims to test software components against requirements.
- **Integration testing** is a direct form of *functional test* that tests a specific slice of functionality against the requirements.
- **Unit testing** is a subtype of *functional testing* that tests individual units of code agains the requirements.
- **System testing** tests the entire application against the requirements.
- **User acceptance testing** tests whether the user accepts the end-product as meeting their requirements.

## Non-Functional Testing
Non-functional testing tests how well a system works, this gives measure of different aspects of a systems behaviour and user experience.
- **Reliability testing** tests how well the system operates under specific conditions for some amount of time.
- **Stress tests** tests the response of a system to sudden stresses not commonly exposed to, such as large spikes of web traffic in the holiday periods or during sales.
- **Performance tests** test the responsiveness of a system and processing speed when under load.
- **Usability tests** tests how usable a system is by the end-user.

## Regression Testing
**Regression testing** is the process of re-running tests that may be affected by a change to a code base. This is a key process in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that can highlight bugs in code.
